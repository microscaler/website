AdiDoks is a modern documentation theme, which is a port of the Hugo
theme [Doks](https://github.com/h-enk/doks) for Zola.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd website
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

Read more from [the document of the AdiDoks](https://adidoks.org/docs/getting-started/introduction/).

## Installation

Just earlier we showed you how to run the theme directly. Now we start to
install the theme in an existing site step by step.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install AdiDoks

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone https://github.com/aaranxu/adidoks.git
```


### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

AdiDoks will start the Zola development web server accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.
